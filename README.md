# Overview 

In this task, we built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer would purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data from the Bank Marketing dataset. The dataset was preprocessed by handling categorical variables and splitting the data into training and test sets. We then trained a decision tree classifier using the training data and evaluated its performance on the test set using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the model, and the final model was saved for future use. This project demonstrates how to effectively preprocess data, build a decision tree, and evaluate model performance for classification tasks.
